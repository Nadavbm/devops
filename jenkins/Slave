Configure Jenkins for Publish over SSH plugin builds:
To configure publish over ssh go to "Manage Jenkins" --> "Manage Plugins" and install "Publish over ssh" plugin.

Create .ssh directory for root (if it doesn't exist):

# mkdir -m 700 /root/.ssh
# chmod 700 -R /root/.ssh
# restorecon -r /root/.ssh
# chown -R root:root /root/.ssh/
Create authorized_keys file in that folder:

# touch /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
Create key pairs for Jenkins server (Keep all defaults):

# cd /root/.ssh/
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
16:27:70:a9:fe:46:31:50:4d:66:3a:75:ae:91:16:33 root@rooti
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|      ..o+E .    |
|      .o.=.B     |
|       o= = .    |
|      . o* o     |
|     .  So.      |
|      ...        |
|       o         |
|        o        |

#
Create ssh directory for Jenkins home:

# mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
# chmod -R 700 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
# chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
Touch known_hosts file to /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh:

# touch /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
# chmod -R 611 /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
# chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/known_hosts
Copy the private key and the public ket to the jenkins home directory:

# cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa* /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
Permissions in the end should look like this:

# ll /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
total 8
-rwx------. 1 jenkins jenkins 3247 Jun 12 09:15 id_rsa
-rwx------. 1 jenkins jenkins  746 Jun 12 09:15 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--. 1 jenkins jenkins    0 Jun 12 10:20 known_hosts
Add the public key to the relevant ssh node:

# cd /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
# ssh-copy-id -i devuser@serverip
Your ssh connection is ready, now we need to connect to Jenkins browser and configure the server.

Go to Jenkins browser via port 8080 - http://jenkins-server:8080 --> Manage Jenkins --> Configure System and go to "Publish over SSH" section.



As you can see in the print-screen above, you need to copy the id_rsa private key to the Key section, server ip to Hostname, User and Home directory.

Test the configuration until it successful.

You node is ready for "Publish over SSH"


Configure SSH slave for Jenkins Master:
To configure ssh agent for Jenkins, create key pairs on the slave and transfer the private key to Jenkins master.
In ssh communication for Jenkins, the master will use the private key and the slave will use the public key.
Go to http://jenkins-master:8080 via browser:
Install SSH agent on Jenkins master --> Manage plugins -> Available plugins -> Install SSH agent plugin
In Jenkins slave install openssh-server:


# sudo yum install openssh-server
Create user for Jenkins on the slave node:



# sudo adduser jenkins
# sudo passwd jenkins
# sudo usermod -aG wheel jenkins
Log in as jenkins user and create .ssh directory and authorized_keys file:



# su jenkins
$ mkdir ~/.ssh/
$ touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Create public and private key pairs on the slave node:



$ cd ~/.ssh/; ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "slave_hostname" -f "slave_hostname"
Add the public key to the authorized_keys file:



$ cat slave_hostname.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Set permissions for jenkins user:


$ sudo chown -R jenkins /home/jenkins/.ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 /home/jenkins/.ssh
$ sudo chmod 600 /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
Copy the private key (In the command it's slave_hostname) to Jenkins master:


Option 1 -
Copy the private key from the slave node:


# cat /home/jenkins/.ssh/slave_hostname
In Jenkins master open browser to http://jenkins-master:8080

Manage Credentials --> Global Credentials --> Add Credentials
Choose to add credentials from a file and paste the private key of the slave

Option 2 -
From the slave node copy the private key with scp:


# scp /home/jenkins/.ssh/slave_hostname root@jenkins_master:/root/.ssh/


Run chmod in Jenkins master:


# chmod 700 /root/.ssh/slave_hostname


Note that you might need to assign more permissions to jenkins (Option 1 is preferable)
In Jenkins master open browser to http://jenkins-master:8080
Manage Credentials --> Global Credentials --> Add Credentials
Choose Add credentials from a file and type the path to the key:
/root/.ssh/slave_hostname
If OpenJDK isn't installed on the slave node, connect to the slave with ssh and run:

# sudo yum install java-1.7.0-openjdk
Note that if you won't install jdk, Jenkins server will install it automatically on the slave.
